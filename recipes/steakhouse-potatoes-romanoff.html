    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My potatoes Romanoff is an ideal dish for big holiday gatherings since you can make it the day before and bake it when needed. Featuring shredded baked russet potatoes and sweet shallots fluffed up with sour cream and lots of Cheddar cheese, this delicious potato casserole is the perfect side dish for any cut of steak. Chef John Schenk taught me how to make this special potato gratin ten years ago at his restaurant Strip House in Las Vegas.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced shallots</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Poke holes into potatoes using a knife. Wrap each potato in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let potatoes cool to room temperature. Unwrap and place on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Leave skin on potatoes. Use a cheese grater to shred potatoes into a large bowl. Add shallots to potatoes; season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Toss with two forks until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and mix well. Gently toss in sour cream until barely combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish, piling it up high, then patting it down very lightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and the top is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons fine salt in place of the kosher salt. Ground black pepper can be used instead of white.</p>
    <p>If you do use shallots, note that a little will go a long way because they go in raw. Feel free to saute them in a little butter to take off the sharp, raw edge. Besides shallots, some thinly sliced green onions would be great, as would sauteed leeks, or even just finely minced yellow onions.</p>
